    <h1 style="color: blue;">How to Cook Chicken Curry</h1>
    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style =background-color:lightgrey;>
        <li>4–6 pieces chicken thighs or legs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 tbsp chopped ginger</li>
        <li>3 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 400ml-can coconut milk </li>
        <li> 1 400ml-can coconut cream</li>
        <li> 2 red or green bell peppers, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>3 tsp fish sauce or patis</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Cook</h2>
    <ul style =background-color:lightgrey;>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, turning with tongs when necessary, until nicely browned on all sides. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. In the same pan, add onion, garlic and ginger to the remaining oil and fat. Cook aromatics, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until fragrant and golden, about 3–5 minutes. Before the last minute of cooking, add curry powder and stir to toast, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Return browned chicken to the pan. Add coconut milk and cream. Bring the mixture to a low boil, then add potatoes. Stir to incorporate. Reduce heat so the curry cooks at a simmer. Cover pan and cook until chicken is tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cover and add bell peppers. Stir to incorporate and cook until bell peppers have softened a bit but are still crunchy.</li>
        <li>Taste and season curry with fish sauce, adding more to taste if necessary. Transfer to a serving bowl and enjoy hot with lots of rice.</li>
    </ul>
    </ol>
